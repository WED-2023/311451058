    <h1>About Ori</h1>
    <p>Ori, son of Siglit and Shay, was born in Petah Tikva on the 28th day of Bayer 5574 (05.09.1994). Middle child in the family, brother to Hila and Hedi Hezekiah.</p>
    <p>Grew up in Petah Tikva, studied at the religious elementary school of science "Deat Mevinim" in the city, and at the "Bnei Akiva Kiryat Herzog" yeshiva in Bnei Brak. A charming and captivating boy, he loved to play football and was an ardent fan of the "Liverpool" team.</p>
    <p>In the army, he served in a classified role in the Air Force's intelligence system, and after his release, he flew on a long trip to Australia, New Zealand and other countries. He loved to travel a lot and visited abroad a lot, and at every station in his life, in Israel and in the world, he gathered dozens of new friends.</p>
    <p>In the last three years of his life, he studied electrical engineering at "Ben Gurion" University in Be'er Sheva, and lived in the city in a shared apartment. In October 2023 he was supposed to start the fourth and final year of studies.</p>
    <p>On Saturday, the 22nd of Tashri, Simchat Torah Tashpad, October 7, 2023, at six thirty in the morning, the terrorist organization Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel.</p>
    <p>Under the auspices of a massive fire of missiles and rockets from the Gaza Strip into large areas of the country, thousands of terrorists penetrated through the breached border fence, from the sea and from the air and began a murderous attack on the settlements surrounding Gaza - kibbutzim and moshavim - and on the nearby cities,</p>
    <p>on parties near Kibbutz Re'im and Nirim, on the IDF bases and those passing by on the roads in the area.</p>
    <p>The terrorists murdered approximately eight hundred civilians of all ages in their homes, in their cars and while they were at parties after committing serious crimes against them, including rape and abuse; they kidnapped hundreds of Israelis to the Gaza Strip - soldiers and civilians as well as foreign workers from the kibbutzim; they destroyed, Looted and set fire to houses and property.</p>
    <p>Ori worked as a bartender at the "Nova" festival, which was held between October 6 and 7 near Kibbutz Reim and included about 3,000 ravers. He arrived at the festival on Friday night, close to 2:00 am, together with his best friend, Noa Argamani, and her partner Avinatan Or. A few hours later the attack began.</p>
    <p>Ori took care of those around him first of all. He served water to people who were in shock, took care of the wounded, bandaged and put a tourniquet when necessary, and only when he realized that his life was in real danger, he decided to run away and hide in his car. There, apparently, he was shot by the terrorists. For several days he was considered missing, until the news of his murder was received.</p>
    <p>Ori Tschernihovsky was murdered at the "Nova" festival, near Kibbutz Ra'im, in the 22nd of Tashri Tashpad (07.10.2023). He was 29 years old when he died. He was laid to rest in Segulah Cemetery, Petah Tikva. He left his parents, brother and sister and many loving friends.</p>
